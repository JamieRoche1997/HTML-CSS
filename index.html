    <p>
      Throughout the COVID-19 lockdowns, people came up with extremely creative and fun games to keep themselves occupied and entertained. The activity which we noticed gaining the most traction was a game called "Balloon Keepy Uppy". Due to the interest in this game, students came forward and proposed a new sports club. The goal of this club is to provide a fun way for people to exercise and clear their minds from the COVID-19 pandemic and stress of examinations while potentially, going even further to create a team to represent the Univesity in competitions.

    <h3>The Game</h3>

    <p>
      You may remember having played this game unbeknownst to yourself with your siblings be that with leftover balloons from one of your birthday parties or a takeaway balloon from McDonald's. So you may already be an expert at the sport already so why not give it a shot?
    </p>

      The rules are simple - there are only two:
    <ul>
      <li>You can’t hinder your opponent’s path to the balloon</li>
      <li>All hits must be in an upward motion — making it illegal to spike the balloon into the ground, like a game of volleyball.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Training</h3>

    <p>
      Training will take place inside the MTU gym and will be on twice a week from 19:00-20:00 on Tuesday and Thursday.

    <h3>Interest in Art & Design?</h3>

    <p>
      You're probably thinking, "Wait, what? I thought this was a sports club?" and you're right however, we're also aware that sports aren't for everyone but that doesn't mean we don't want you to join our club and be involved.

    <br><br>

      If you have an interest in art, why don't you sign up anyway and we can set up a team who will be responsible for creating and designing a space for these matches to take place!
